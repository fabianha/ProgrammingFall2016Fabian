2016.09.25 - Hi Fabien, looks like you took a shot at the second homework
but didn't quite get the questions. If you ever have questions, don't be
afraid to send me an email, I'm essentially ALWAYS at my computer and respond
obsessively fast to new mail. Also, thanks for your quesitons in class! Many
of the students don't ask questions even though they aren't following, so it
is good to have someone voice their concerns. Keep up the good work and see you
Friday!

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Nice work Fabian. You should note the order of the
coefficients you generate being different from what R gives, driven by the
order in which you put the columns of X.
